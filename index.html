        <h1>some information about me</h1>
        <p>A collegiate senior at Ball State University, studying Computer
            Science and Classics. I have created this website for a couple
            of reasons. Primarily, it is used as a place to display some of
            the work I am most proud of, both personal work and projects
            I have worked on in a professional environment.
            <br><br>
            Additionally, it is a place for me to share myself with the
            world personally, and let family, friends, and future employers
            alike know that I am an individual with passion, drive, and an
            easy going mind. Below, you will, as I said, see examples of
            my work, but you will also find a glimpse into my personal life.
            <br><br>
            Enjoy!

                <h2>Innovate WithIN™</h2>
                <p>
                    Innovate WithIN™ was a project for the Indiana Department of
                    education, which called for and mixed all of the different
                    talents I've got. It involved a registration system, a login system,
                    profile management, dynamic video content, and more.<br><br>
                    The front-end of the website was built
                    on a React.js framework with intricate database integration.
                    The backend was built using PHP and a MySQL database, and was
                    the sandbox in which I learned all about CRUD (Create, Read,
                    Update, Delete). It took roughly a year to create, and is
                    now in the hands of the IEDC.

                <h2>BSU Chirper App</h2>
                <p>
                    The Ball State University 'Chirper' is an official university
                    app, available on both iOS and Android. The app was originally
                    created years ago, and was used in Apple's official demo on
                    application creation.
                    <br><br>
                    This reworking of the app was a complete overhaul, taking the
                    one screen app to a multifaceted system which included the
                    original app as well as three original games, the school's
                    fight song, and a download-able 'sticker' package. The app now has
                    several thousand downloads, and is used every day by BSU students
                    and staff.

                <h2>Sales & Marketing</h2>
                <p>
                    This project for Ball State's Miller College of Business was
                    rather interesting in nature because I came on several months
                    into the project, when it was supposed to be done. It was my first
                    test as a developer working with a previously built code-base.
                    <br><br>
                    We built a slick Wordpress / React.js article posting and resource
                    sharing site where approved members could sign up to share and
                    receive articles related to Sales and Marketing. This involved
                    building custom WP plugins and bending the rules of React plugins
                    to work for our needs. All in all, it ended in great fashion.

                <h2>Clearpath [ DCP* ]</h2>
                <p>
                    Clearpath, also known as Dual Credit Pathways, was, for me, an
                    adventure in CSS/Javascript animations. This Wordpress site
                    was created in just a few weeks, is completely dynamic in all of
                    it's content. It's purpose is to allow high school students to
                    explore collegiate dual credit options at Ball State University.
                    <br><br>
                    The team of developers was tasked with creating a three tiered system
                    of categories, sub-categories, and posts, which a user could
                    navigate through in an interactive, animated system of clicks. These
                    circles, while they look simple, caused many a headache!
